# hello-world

Konnnichiwa.
My workplace is at 3,000 meter in a mountain lodge.
My Granpa made it and I took it over from my dad.
It places in Japan North Alps, near Mt.Okuhotakadake.
(Though I'm in a town at the foot now because I have children who are 3 and 0 years old)

I'm going to make an iPhone app.
So I signed in Github!
